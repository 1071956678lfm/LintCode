     * Given an array of unique integers, each integer is strictly greater than 1.
     * <p>
     * We make a binary tree using these integers and each number may be used for any number of times.
     * <p>
     * Each non-leaf node's value should be equal to the product of the values of it's children.
     * <p>
     * How many binary trees can we make?  Return the answer modulo 10 ** 9 + 7.
     * <p>
     * Example 1:
     * <p>
     * Input: A = [2, 4]
     * Output: 3
     * Explanation: We can make these trees: [2], [4], [4, 2, 2]
     * Example 2:
     * <p>
     * Input: A = [2, 4, 5, 10]
     * Output: 7
     * Explanation: We can make these trees: [2], [4], [5], [10], [4, 2, 2], [10, 2, 5], [10, 5, 2].
